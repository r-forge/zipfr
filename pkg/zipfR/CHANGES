TODO:

  - write/check documentation for bootstrapping and confidence intervals
  - implement & document robust boostrapping confidence intervals (confint.lnre)
  - write documentation for new posterior, Good-Turing, etc.
  - complete implementation and documentation of posterior densities etc.
  - auto.gzfile() helper no longer needed -> remove
  - add encoding options to read.tfl

RECENT CHANGES to the 'zipfR' package:

  - posterior distribution for LNRE model as Bayesian prior, with density function
    postdlnre(), including log-transformed version postldlnre(), as well as
    cumulative probability postplnre() and quantiles postqlnre() where available
  - Good-Turing estimates with gtlnre()
  - NB: these functions are only partially implemented so far
  
Version 0.6-6

  - interim release for compliance with new, stricter CRAN requirements
  - Zipf-ranking plots for type-frequency lists (of class "tfl")
  - file I/O automatically compresses/decompresses ".gz" files in functions
    read.tfl(), read.spc(), read.vgc(), write.tfl(), write.spc(), write.vgc()
  - dropped support for very old R versions (before 2.3.1 or so),
    where read.delim() does not accept comment.char= option; now requires 2.10.1+
  - removed zipfR.legend() function since standard legend() now offers the same
    convenient placement options
  - added citation details (file inst/CITATION), which can be displayed with
    citation(package="zipfR")
  - upgraded to GPL v3

Version 0.6-5

  - moved development to SVN repository on R-Forge

Version 0.6-4

  - various bug fixes and minor improvements
  - improved robustness and tolerance for rounding errors in expected frequency spectra

Version 0.6-2

  - added function read.multiple.objects to do just that

Version 0.6-1

  - bugfix: read.vgc() died on input files without at least a V1 column

Version 0.6-0

  - first public release on CRAN
  - improved parameter estimation, can be fine-tuned by users 
    with choice of cost functions and minimization algorithms
  - default settings work well for most data sets
  - minor bug fixes and improved documentation
  - updated version of tutorial


Version 0.5-0

  - first beta release of the zipfR toolkit
